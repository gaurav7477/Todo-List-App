# How my Todo List app works

# My Todo List app is a React web application that uses Node.js and MongoDB on the backend. The app allows users to create, manage, and delete to-do items.

# Frontend code

# The frontend code is written in React and uses React Router to handle routing. The main component is the App component, which renders the Header and Router components.

# # The Header component contains the app title and links to the home and profile pages.

# The Router component renders the different pages of the app, such as the home page, login page, and register page.

# The home page contains a form for adding new to-do items and a list of all existing to-do items. The login page and register page are used for users to log in and create new accounts, respectively.

# Backend code

# The backend code is written in Node.js and uses MongoDB to store data. The main backend code is located in the server.js file.

# The server.js file defines the following routes:

/users/login: This route is used for users to log in.
/users/new: This route is used for users to create new accounts.
/task/new: This route is used to create new to-do items.
/task/my: This route is used to get all of the to-do items for the current user.
/task/:id: This route is used to get a specific to-do item.
/task/:id: This route is used to update a specific to-do item.
/task/:id: This route is used to delete a specific to-do item.
